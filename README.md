## Analysations
- Is there a correlation between the emotion of a song and the tempo?
- Do popular songs tend to have higher danceability than less popular ones?
- How do songs differ across decades in terms of valence, tempo, and energy?
- Do songs tagged as "Good for Study" have distinct musical features (e.g., lower tempo, higher acousticness)?
